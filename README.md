Troubleshooting:
 - had trouble adjusting the height since they were fixed values in tailwind.config.js file
    - I could adjust the height parameters for `h-1, h-1` etc or use “arbitrary values”
    - Used <strong> arbitrary values </strong> instead for a faster customization of height values.
    - went from "`h-96 to h-[60vh]`" for images

Tailwind CSS Experience:
 - The experience of using tailwind css was confusing since I am still a beginner at CSS. I knew what I had to do through CSS, but I still had to look up documentation to know what those CSS properties meant when converted to tailwind. Despite the setbacks and confusion, I do believe that tailwind css is faster and more convenient once you are more familiar with it; although you do need to have your “`tailwind.config.js`”  fully customized for what you want to do to truly take advantage of tailwind.

CSS Framework:
<a href="https://www.browserstack.com/guide/top-css-frameworks" target="_blank"> CSS frameworks</a> are ready to use CSS stylesheets for web design functions. They serve as toolkits for web developers and designers.
advantages include:
 - implementing advanced visual elements and features on a website (forms, different buttons, etc)
 - reduces the likelihood of bugs due to the ease of making websites compatible with various browsers
 - allows faster use of styling due to the ready-to-use stylesheets made.
